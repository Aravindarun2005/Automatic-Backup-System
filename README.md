Automatic File Backup System (Google Drive)
===========================================

A Java-based desktop application developed entirely using Notepad and Command Prompt (CMD) without using any IDE.
The system automates file backup from a local system to Google Drive, ensuring data safety through scheduled cloud backups.

Overview
===========================================

The Automatic File Backup System allows users to select local folders and automatically back them up to Google Drive at scheduled intervals.
The application uses rclone for cloud synchronization and maintains local logs to track backup history and execution status.

This project demonstrates command-line–based Java development, file handling, scheduling mechanisms, and third-party tool integration.

System Capabilities
===========================================

*Automatic backup of selected local folders

*Scheduled backup execution

*Google Drive cloud integration

*Backup history tracking

*Log file generation

*Background execution using threads

Technologies Used
===========================================

Language: Java (compiled and executed via Command Prompt)

Cloud Tool: Rclone

Libraries: Core Java, Swing, AWT

File Handling: CSV, TXT

Tools:
===========================================

Command Prompt (CMD)

Notepad (Code Editor)

No IDE is used in this project.

Folder Description
===========================================

src/ – Contains all Java source code files

bin/ – Stores compiled .class files generated by javac

lib/ – Contains rclone.exe for Google Drive integration

assets/images/ – Icons and UI images used in the application

logs/ – Backup history and execution logs

README.md – Project documentation

**Please ensure that you download images from the assets/images folder before you run the program.**

Prerequisites
===========================================

Java JDK 8 or above

Rclone (Windows version)

Active internet connection

Google Drive account

Rclone Configuration

Download rclone from https://rclone.org/downloads/

Place rclone.exe inside the lib/ folder

Open Command Prompt

Run:

rclone config


Configure Google Drive as the remote storage

Create a folder in Google Drive named BackupFolder

How to Compile and Run (CMD Only)
===========================================

Open Command Prompt:
--------------------

cd path\to\AutomaticFileBackupSystem\src

Compile:
-----------

javac FileBackupSquareTabs.java

Run:
--------

java FileBackupSquareTabs

How the System Works
===========================================

User selects a local folder for backup

Backup schedule is configured

A background thread monitors the schedule

At the scheduled time:

rclone copy command is executed

Files are uploaded to Google Drive

Backup details are stored in:

backup_log.txt

folder_contents.csv

Backup History

The system records:

File name

File path

Backup date and time

Upload status

Backup data is stored in CSV format and displayed using a JTable.

Screenshots
===========================================

Screenshots of the application interface are available in the screenshots folder.

Future Enhancements
===========================================

Convert the application into a standalone .exe file

Run the application silently in the background

Notify users when:

Backup fails

Internet connection is unavailable during backup

Detect system shutdown during backup and notify the user after restart

Resume or retry backup after failures

Add email or desktop notifications

Encrypt files before uploading

Support multiple cloud storage providers
